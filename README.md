# ‚öô dotfiles

My personal dotfiles I use in Linux and Windows.

## üêß Linux

To install, run `./install.sh` and follow the prompts.

### misc

`~/sowm/config.h` is my configuration for [sowm](https://github.com/dylanaraps/sowm), my current desktop of choice.

`/etc/systemd/system/lock.service` is a simple system service for running my lock script on suspend.

My current fish config, `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, simply adds `~/bin` to `$PATH`.

### functions

These are the various aliases I have set in [fish](https://fishshell.com/).

`lh` List hidden files in a shorter command.

`mkdir` Have mkdir always run with -pv.

`sudo !!` & `sudo!!` Run previous command as root.

`vi` Ensure vi always opens vim.

### bin

Some of these also have .desktop files to facilitate easy launching from GUI launchers.
