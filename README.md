## üåü Key Components

### Starship Prompt

This repository uses [Starship](https://starship.rs/), a minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable cross-platform prompt. The `starship.toml` configuration provides:

- Customized prompt symbol (dot) with color-coding for success/failure
- Git branch and status information displayed on the right
- Directory path display with customizable truncation
- Special indicators for SSH sessions
- Vim mode indicators
- Python environment detection

### Antidote Plugin Manager

The repository uses [Antidote](https://getantidote.github.io/), a fast and flexible plugin manager for ZSH:

- Simpler, cleaner plugin management
- Faster shell startup time
- All plugins defined in a single `.zsh_plugins.txt` file
- Support for modern ZSH plugins and functionality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always review the scripts before running them to ensure they match your needs.
- Replace the git configuration with your own information (`GIT_USER_NAME` and `GIT_USER_EMAIL` variables).
- Some applications may require additional manual setup after installation.
- These scripts are designed for personal use and may need adjustment for your specific environment.
